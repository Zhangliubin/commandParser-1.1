# What is command-line-interface?

**Command Line Interface (CLI)** is a text-based user interface for program running, file management, and computer interaction. Similar to software graphical interface and Web service, command-line interface helps implement the transformation between the internal form of program operation and the human-acceptable form. Generally, the command line interface receives the commands from external hardware (e.g. keyboard), and parses the commands into parameters or associated settings, and then initiates the back-end computing tasks.

Packaging the program as a runnable JAR package in Java facilitates its transmission and use on different platforms, without considering the IDE environment and tedious configuration. A JAR package usually contains all the codes for a set of complete calculation, analysis and service. In order to enable the JAR package to execute different tasks according to input parameters, the command line needs to be efficiently parsed. Thus, an effective command line parsing tool will helps improve development efficiency and interactive experience.
